Given an array of positive integers arr[] and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of arr[] with sum equal to given sum. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], sum = 9
Output: true 
Explanation: Here there exists a subset with target sum = 9, 4+3+2 = 9.
Input: arr[] = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], sum = 30
Output: false
Explanation: There is no subset with target sum 30.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], sum = 6
Output: true
Explanation: The entire array can be taken as a subset, giving 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 200
1<= arr[i] <= 200
1<= sum <= 104

class Solution:
    
    def isSubsetSum (self, arr, sum):
        dp=[False]*(sum+1)
        dp[0]=True
        
        for i in arr:
            for j in range(sum,i-1,-1):
                dp[j]=dp[j] or dp[j-i]
                
        return dp[sum]
