'''
Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

Input: s = "bbabcbcab"
Output: 7
Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are palindromic and all have a length 1.
Input: s = "agbdba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "abdba", which has a length of 5. The characters in this subsequence are taken from the original string "agbdba", and they maintain the order of the string while forming a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 1000
The string contains only lowercase letters.

                j=i+l-1
                
                if s[i]==s[j]:
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i+1][j-1]+2
                else:
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j-1])
                    
        return dp[0][n-1]
