'''
You are given a string s and a list dictionary[] of words. Your task is to determine whether the string s can be formed by concatenating one or more words from the dictionary[].

Note: From dictionary[], any word can be taken any number of times and in any order.

Examples :

Input: s = "ilike", dictionary[] = ["i", "like", "gfg"]
Output: true
Explanation: s can be breakdown as "i like".
Input: s = "ilikegfg", dictionary = ["i", "like", "man", "india", "gfg"]
Output: true
Explanation: s can be breakdown as "i like gfg".
Input: s = "ilikemangoes", dictionary = ["i", "like", "man", "india", "gfg"]
Output: false
Explanation: s cannot be formed using dictionary[] words.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 3000
1 ≤ dictionary.size() ≤ 1000
1 ≤ dictionary[i].size() ≤ 100

    def wordBreak(self, s, dictionary):
        ws=set(dictionary)
        ml=max(map(len,dictionary)) if dictionary else 0
        n=len(s)
        dp=[False]*(n+1)
        dp[0]=True
        
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(max(0,i-ml),i):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in ws:
                    dp[i]=True
                    break
                
        return dp[n]
