Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to climb 1 stair. 
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 ways to reach 2th stair: {1, 1} and {2}.  
Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five ways to reach 4th stair: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1} and {2, 2}.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 44
