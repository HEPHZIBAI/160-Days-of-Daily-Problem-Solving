Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Circular Property:

Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
Output: [3 4 4 -1]
Explanation:
The next greater element for 1 is 3.
The next greater element for 3 is 4.
The next greater element for 2 is 4.
The next greater element for 4 does not exist, so return -1.
Input: arr[] = [0 2 3 1 1]
Output: [2 3 -1 2 2]
Explanation:
The next greater element for 0 is 2.
The next greater element for 2 is 3.
The next greater element for 3 does not exist, so return -1.
The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal).
The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal). 
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 109

                res[i]=stk[-1]
