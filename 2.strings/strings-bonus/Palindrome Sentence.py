'''
Given a single string s, the task is to check if it is a palindrome sentence or not. A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters, such as word, phrase, or series of symbols that reads the same backward as forward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

Examples:

Input: s = "Too hot to hoot"
Output: true
Explanation: If we remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, string s will become “toohottohoot” which is a palindrome.
Input: s = "Abc 012..## 10cbA"
Output: true
Explanation: If we remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, string s will become “abc01210cba” which is a palindrome.
Input: s = "ABC $. def01ASDF"
Output: false
Explanation: The processed string becomes "abcdef01asdf", which is not a palindrome.
Constraints:
1<= s.size() <= 106

	def sentencePalindrome(self, s):
		filtered=''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())
		return filtered==filtered[::-1]
